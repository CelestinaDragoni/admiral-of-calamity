# Admiral of Calamity Chrome Extension

Removes those pesky admiral pop ups when you have an ad-blocker, pihole, or hosts file blocker on. This should be effective for a while because they are stupidly vain and put their logo and URL on everything making it effective as a target for removal.

## Manual Install

- Download repo and put somewhere you're not gonna move it.
- Go to chrome://extensions
- Click [Load Unpacked] at the top left of the page.
- Open the folder with the extension in it.
- Enjoy.
